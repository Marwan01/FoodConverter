<p><a href="https://expo.io">Expo</a> is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application. It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code - no Xcode or Android Studio installation required (see <a href="/react-native/docs/getting-started#caveats">Caveats</a>).</p>
<p>Assuming that you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node 8+</a> installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css language-sh">npm install -g expo-cli
</code></pre>
<p>Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":</p>
<pre><code class="hljs css language-sh">expo init AwesomeProject

<span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> AwesomeProject
npm start <span class="hljs-comment">#you can also use: expo start</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will start a development server for you.</p>
